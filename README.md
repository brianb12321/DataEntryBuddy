As a student ambassador at Dakota County Technical College, part of my role is data entry. Throughout my time, I realized there was a **better** and **fasster** way to do data entry. This is when this Chrome extension was born!

# Features

* Instant lookup of student names
* Autofills all form fields when a student ID is selected
* No more need to `CTRL+TAB` and copy data

## The Impact

This Chrome extension sped up my data-entry speed by **50%**!
